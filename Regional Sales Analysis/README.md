# Regional Sales Analysis

# Problem Statement
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project aims to analyse and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.


## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
  - `numpy` – Numerical operations
- **Excel** – Multi-sheet import
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment

## Objectives
- Performing data cleaning and EDA 
- Understanding revenue and profit distribution across **products, channels, and regions**
- Identifying **seasonal trends**, **outliers**, and performance against budgets
- Reducing **concentration risk** and improving **market diversification**

## Insights
- **Monthly Revenue Cycle:** Revenue stays stable between ≈$23M-26.5M across 2014–2017, with no consistent seasonal spikes. Sharpest drop (≈21.2M) occurs in early 2017, indicating a possible one-time disruption.

- **Channel Mix:** Wholesale: 54%. Distributors: 31%. Exports: 15% — opportunity to scale international presence.

- **Top Products (Revenue):**
  - Product 26:118M
  - Product 25:110M
  - Product 13:17M
  - Mid tier:68–75M
  - bottom performers:$52–57M

- **Profit Margins:** Profit margins range broadly from ≈18% to ≈60%, with no strong correlation to unit price. Dense horizontal bands suggest standardized pricing strategies across tiers.

- **Seasonal Volume:** No strong monthly pattern, but slight volume uptick appears around May–June. Early 2017 dip (≈$21.2M) may require investigation.

- **Regional Performance:**
  - California leads: ≈230M Revenue & 7500+ orders.
  - Illinois/Florida/Texas: 85M–110M & ≈3500–4500 orders.
  - NY/Indiana: ≈54M & 2000+ orders.
