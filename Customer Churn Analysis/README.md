# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a companyâ€™s product or service during a given time period. Analyzing churn is crucial for businesses because acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key trends, risk factors, and business insights.
