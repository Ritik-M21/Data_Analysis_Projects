# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company‚Äôs product or service during a given time period. Analyzing churn is crucial for businesses because acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key trends, risk factors, and business insights.

## Problem Statement
Companies in subscription-based or service-oriented industries face a major challenge: customer attrition (churn). Without identifying the reasons behind churn, businesses lose revenue and market share.
Key business questions:
What percentage of customers are churning?
Which customer segments (by contract, tenure, payment method, demographics) are at higher risk of churn?
What are the main factors contributing to customer churn?
How can business stakeholders monitor churn trends in real-time?
The goal of this project is to:
Clean and prepare raw customer data using SQL.

Build interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize churn metrics.

Provide actionable insights that help reduce churn and improve customer retention.
